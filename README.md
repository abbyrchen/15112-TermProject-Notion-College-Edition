# 15112-TermProject-Notion-College-Edition
# Project Description: 
This project is called “Notion: College Edition” and is a version of the organizational app, Notion, specifically for college students. It has pages catered to them like a weekly agenda, master class to-do list, and customizable list and blank page templates. The weekly agenda has options to manually add a task or ask the computer to recursively optimize and insert the task into the agenda based on priority. The master class to-do list is a table where users can add and then look at all the assignments across various classes they must complete. This project should help college students stay organized and assist in managing their schedules well.
